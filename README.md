## Getting Started

Make sure you're using [node 18](https://nodejs.dev/en/about/releases), I recommend using [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) which will allow to simply run:

```
fnm use
```

First install dependencies with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), by running the following command:

```
pnpm install
```

Install [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/installing#install-globally), by running the following command:

```
pnpm add turbo --global
```

Then to run the development server, run the following command:

```
pnpm dev
```

Or with turborepo:

```
turbo dev
```

Your application will be available at http://localhost:5173/ ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Available Tasks

**_Each of the following tasks can be ran with `turbo` instead of `pnpm`, which will be [cached](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/caching)_**

To build for production, run the following command:

```
pnpm build
```

To build preview production build, run the following command:

```
pnpm preview
```

_must have ran `pnpm build` previously_

To run unit tests, run the following command:

```
pnpm test
```

To run e2e tests, run the following command:

```
pnpm e2e
```

To lint, run the following command:

```
pnpm lint
```

_you can run `pnpm lint:fix` to fix all lint errors_

To format, run the following command:

```
pnpm format
```

_you can run `pnpm format:fix` to fix all format errors_

To validate everything, run the following command:

```
pnpm validate
```

## Recommendations

If you need to do more, I recommend the following libraries:

- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/solid/overview) for **data management** which will take care of fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state for you
  - [msw](https://mswjs.io/) for when you start testing your data integrations
- [Solid Router](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-router) for when you need **client side routing**
- [TanStack Table](https://tanstack.com/table/v8/docs/adapters/solid-table) for when you need to build complex **tables** or **data grids**
- [fathom](https://usefathom.com/) for **analytics** which is easy to use
